A Caesar Cipher implemented in Ruby as part of The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/caesar-cipher)

The function runs from the command line and takes 2 arguments

2. shift - an integer defines the shift for each letter in th text string

The case of letters is preserved and non alphabetic characters are ignored.
